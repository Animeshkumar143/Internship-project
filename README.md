**ML and Data Analytics Project**
--------------------------------------
**Task 1: Basic Table**
**Data Information:**
● You’ll be working with the data set here
● The dataset provides information on ML Engineer salaries from 2020 to 2024
● You can either create an API to fetch this data or just put this data in a file in your frontend
codebase.
--------------------------------------
**Description:**
Based on this data, create a table (call it “main table”) with the following columns:
1. Year
2. Number of total jobs for that year
3. Average salary in USD
Users should be able to sort the table by any column.
---------------------------------------
**Task 2: Analytics**
Now our users want to understand this data even further. Using the same data, create the following:
1. A line graph that shows how this number has changed from 2020 to 2024 (kaggle link above has
similar bar graph)
2. Now, when I click a row from our main table, a second table should appear that displays
aggregated job titles and the number of jobs for that year. For example, if the user clicks on
2022, all the titles from 2022 should appear in another table, along with the sum of how many
times each job appeared in 2022
